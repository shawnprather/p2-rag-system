# Using the ObjectDB profiler

Using the ObjectDB profiler

Since Godot 4.6, there is a new ObjectDB Profiler tab in the Debugger bottom panel.
This profiler allows you to take snapshots of the current state of the ObjectDB,
which is the database that contains all the class_object-derived classes
currently allocated in memory. This is useful for identifying memory leaks and
understanding the memory usage of your project.

Additionally, this tool is able to visualize differences between two snapshots.
This can be used to identify improvements or regressions in memory usage after
making changes to your project. Reducing memory usage can lead to better performance,
even in cases where memory is not a bottleneck. By reducing memory usage,
you can perform fewer allocations, which can be a costly operation, especially
if performed in large amounts during gameplay.

Seealso: See doc_node_alternatives for information on using lighter-weight alternatives to nodes, which can help reduce memory usage in your project.
Warning: The ObjectDB profiler does not track every bit of memory used by the engine or by external libraries. Native engine classes that are not exposed to the scripting API will not appear in snapshots. Consider using external memory profiling tools if you need access to this information.
Usage

Open the ObjectDB Profiler tab in the Debugger bottom panel.
You will land on the summary page with no snapshots taken yet.

Run the project, then get to a point where you'd like to take a snapshot
(for example, after loading a level). Click Take ObjectDB Snapshot
to take a snapshot at the current point in time. If the button appears grayed out,
make sure the project is running first.

You can take multiple snapshots during a single run of the project.
Also, you can right-click a snapshot in the snapshot list to rename it,
show it in the file manager, or delete it.

Tip: It's a good idea to rename snapshots after taking them to give them descriptive names (e.g., before_optimization, after_optimization). Regardless of the name, the date at which the snapshot was taken remains saved in the snapshot file itself. Snapshot files have a .odb_snapshot extension and are located in user://objectdb_snapshots/ (see Data paths details). These can safely be copied across devices, as they're platform-independent.
Viewing differences between snapshots

After taking at least two snapshots, the Diff Against dropdown becomes
available. Here, you can select another snapshot to compare the currently selected
snapshot with.

The summary page will then show the differences between the two snapshots:

This also applies to every other tab in the ObjectDB profiler, which will show
the differences between the two snapshots in additional columns.

Classes

In the Classes tab, you can view how many instances of each class have been
created at the moment the snapshot was taken:

When in diff mode, it will show the class instance count for the currently
selected snapshot (column A) and the snapshot that is being diffed against
(column B). It will also show the difference in instance count in the column Delta.

You can click on a class in the list on the right to view it in the inspector.

Tip: Previewing instances in the inspector is also available in other tabs (Nodes, Objects, and RefCounted).
Objects

The Objects tab is similar, but differs in the way it presents data. Here,
every instance is listed in a linear fashion, instead of grouping them by class.
When selecting an object, you will see a list of other objects it references
on the right (Outbound References), as well as a list of objects
it's being referenced by (Inbound References).

This allows you to view objects either in a "top-down" manner (viewing
what objects a given object references) or in a "bottom-up" manner (viewing
what objects reference a given object).

In the above image, clicking the default_font object in the list will
switch the view to the perspective of that object. This object is being
referenced by a lot of other objects as well, which effectively switches
to a "bottom-up" perspective.

Nodes

Next, the Nodes tab shows the scene tree at the time the snapshot was taken.

This tab is particularly interesting in diff view, since it supports showing
the difference between the two snapshots in a more visual manner.
When Combined Diff is unchecked, you can see the differences side by side.

When Combined Diff is checked, you can see the differences merged
into a single tree, with added nodes highlighted in green and removed nodes
highlighted in red.

Additionally, you can view a list of orphan nodes (nodes that are not
attached to the scene tree root) at the end of the tree view. You can view
it more easily by collapsing the root node, since these are listed outside
the main scene tree.

RefCounted

The last tab is the RefCounted tab. This tab is similar to the Objects
tab, but it shows the reference counts of class_refcounted-derived
classes directly in the table. The table has four columns:

Native Refs: The number of native engine references to the object.
ObjectDB Refs: The number of ObjectDB references to the object.
Total Refs: The sum of native references and ObjectDB references.
ObjectDB Cycles: The number of circular references detected.

When in diff view, snapshot B is always listed above snapshot A
if a RefCounted instance exists in both snapshots.

The list on the right shows details on the selected instance,
including a list of references and whether these are duplicates.

Note: The RefCounted tab does not list objects that derive directly from class_object, as these don't use reference counting.
